The combination of a motion planner for the trajectory of the robotâ€™s center of mass, a momentum-based observer estimator, and an optimization problem based on the modulation of ground reaction forces allows the robot to reject external disturbances.

The repository contains the following elements:
 * A quadruped robot model  already implemented inside the Gazebo simulator;
 * A plugin to simulate external forces stressing the robot;
 * A scene reproducing an irregular terrain;
 * Some examples to test the proposed controller.

# Instructions

The code was tested with Ubuntu 18.04, and ROS Melodic. Different OS and ROS versions are possible but not supported.

### Install dependencies

`sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-ros-control ros-melodic-ros-controllers`

### Clone the following packages 

```cd <CATKIN_WS_DIR>/src```

`git clone https://github.com/prisma-lab/WBC_quadruped_DOB/tree/main/dogbot_controller`

`git clone https://github.com/prisma-lab/WBC_quadruped_DOB/tree/main/DogBotV4`

`git clone https://github.com/prisma-lab/WBC_quadruped_DOB/tree/main/force_plugin`


### Compile 

`catkin_make`

### Run simulation
Choose the case study inside force_plugin.cpp

`roslaunch dogbot_gazebo gztest.launch paused:=true`

`rosrun dogbot_controller dogbot /yourpath/<CATKIN_WS_sir>/src/DogbotV4/ROS/src/dogbot_description/urdf/dogbot.urdf`

Press play in gazebo to start the simulation
